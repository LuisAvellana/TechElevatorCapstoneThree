# 3rd Capstone Project at Tech Elevator

In this project I mob programmed with 3 other students to create an app that would eventually be named Echo. During this project we also used Agile software development throughout. 

Our product was a single page app used for studying with flash cards. Users can create decks, modify deck details, modify cards in deck, create flash cards, modify existing cards, and start and complete study sessions.

We created the database in PostgreSQL, RESTful API in Java, and did everything front-end in Vue.js. 

This work was done after 12 weeks of class lectures.
